<h1 id="title" align="center">gamedeals-api</h1>

<p id="description">This project was based on the open-source API provided by CheapShark to list the most varied game sales available in many stores. It's been coded in Kotlin for the server-side part using SpringBoot framework and Java for the client's interface. It's been quite a challenge and there are many things yet to be improved and fixed.</p>
